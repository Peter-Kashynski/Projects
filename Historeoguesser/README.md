Collaborative Web Application â€” Awarded First Place in "Best Data and Maps"

Worked with a team of three to build a high-performance, interactive web application centered around user location guessing. Led front-end design using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive and intuitive interface. Integrated third-party client-side APIs (such as Leaflet or Google Maps) to power interactive maps and real-time user movement.

Contributed to core game logic on both the front and back end to ensure accurate scoring and smooth gameplay. The project was recognized with first place in the "Best Data and Maps" category for its innovative use of spatial data and interactive design.

Technologies Used:

Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Maps/API Integration: Leaflet.js or Google Maps API (depending on what was used)

Back End: Node.js or Flask (adjust as needed)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Collaboration: Pair programming, Git branching, team planning

If you want to download these files and run it yourself, you must run it on a live server! To connect with the Google Map API, the files have to be able to connect to the internet, so a live server is required. The easiest way to do this is using the Live Server extension in VSCode.

To run the file locally, run index.html on the live server. Everything else should take care of itself!
